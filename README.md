ðŸŒŸ Containerized the MERN Application Using Docker Compose:

Recently working on the docker now I successfully containerized a 3-tier MERN application with Docker Compose. Docker is a powerful containerization tool that allows us to customize and manage applications efficiently. To handle multiple services in an application, Docker Compose is used to orchestrate various Docker containers and manage their configurations.

In this project, I deployed a three-tier application consisting of:

Front-end: Built with React and served by a container.
Back-end: Built with Node.js and served by a separate container.
Database: MongoDB, managed in its container.

By using Docker Compose, I could effectively manage and scale these services. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of Docker Compose and its capabilities.
